# Cryptocurrency-Trading-Bot using sentiment analysis on Reddit

## Abstract:
The objective of this project was to make a bot in python to facilitate the automating of trading in cryptocurrencies. The bot will run on autonomously, analyzing the sentiment of the selected subreddit(s) and trying to make accurate trades that will result in an accumulation of profit for the user. It does so by fetching the subreddit information through the praw library & the reddit API & trading of cryptocurrency using the Binance API & library. The trading strategy involves the use of Bollinger Bands. The trading bot makes multiple buys and sell calls based on the information that it gets from the Bollinger Bands, and tries to maximize profit while limiting risks. The bot can also use various financial performance indicators using the technical analysis library. It is set to do trades based on the RSI indicator by default.

Bot performs tokenization and lemmatization using Regular Expressions, Emoji, Contractions & NLTK libraries on the posts & comments of the subreddit page. Using TF- IDF Vectorization and Random Forest Classifier, it predicts the sentiment of data. Then, every 10 minutes, it checks the sentiment of new comments, takes the average with the previous sentiment, and checks the change in the cryptocurrency price. If both sentiment and change in price are positive, then the bot buys, if both are negative, it sells else it retains.
